This thesis presents Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) designing with 
the help of Maxeler OS and Reverse Time Migration (RTM) algorithm, which is 
the most computationally demanding algorithm in oil and gas exploration 
operations. In addition, the thesis presents FPGA-based solution for the 
RTM algorithm.

By utilizing the reconfigurability of the FPGA device, my RTM design 
manages to speed up the calculation in term of the hardware calculation 
instead of software calculation. When comparing to Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 
CPU, the naive implementation of FPGA achieves 6X speed up without any 
optimization. 

I think FPGA is becoming efficient High Performance Computing solution, 
which is an alternative to conventional CPU and GPU, because it has 
abundant computation and storage resources on the board. What more, 
paralleling the FPGA kernel by utilizing more FPGA resource is a good way to 
optimize the FPGA kernel, which will result in better performance. 
Meanwhile, users can provide other boost to the performance as they can 
perform customization on various aspect of the design. These unique 
properties makes FPGAs a preferable choice for many 
computationally-intensive application.
